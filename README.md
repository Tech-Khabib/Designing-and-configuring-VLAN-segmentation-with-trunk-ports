**VLAN-Based Network Segmentation for Enterprises**
This repository provides configurations, diagrams, and documentation for implementing **VLAN-based network segmentation** in enterprise environments. It supports multi-vendor setups and automation for scalable, secure network deployments.
**Key Features**

**Multi-vendor support**:** Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, Arista EOS
**Automation-ready****: Deployment via Python (Netmiko/NAPALM) and Ansible
**Modular VLAN design****: Templates for scalable network segmentation
**Security-focused**: VLAN pruning, native VLAN separation, ACLs
  **Validation scripts**: To verify configuration and connectivity

**What's Covered**
VLAN design strategies for scalability and compliance
Access & trunk port configurations (Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS)
Inter-VLAN routing (SVI, Layer 3 routing, ACLs)
Security best practices for enterprise segmentation
Automated provisioning using Python & Ansible
Real-world deployment templates for various verticals


**Real-Life Use Cases**

**Corporate Office Segmentation**
Finance VLAN (Secure): PCI-DSS compliant, isolated payment systems
Guest VLAN (Restricted): Internet-only, rate-limited visitor access

**Hospital Network (HIPAA Compliance)**

Medical Devices VLAN: QoS-enabled, traffic prioritization (e.g., MRI, PACS)
BYOD VLAN: Isolate personal mobile devices from EHR systems

**University Campus**
Student VLAN: Internet access with filtering and bandwidth caps
Research VLAN: High-speed access to lab equipment and compute resources
**
Retail Chain (PCI Compliance)**

POS VLAN: Secure, encrypted card transaction isolation
Surveillance VLAN: Separate IP cameras from transaction traffic

**Manufacturing Plant (OT/IT Convergence)**

Industrial IoT VLAN: Segregate PLCs, robots from enterprise systems
Maintenance VLAN: Temporary, port-secured vendor access

**Production Ready**
VLAN segmentation by department (Finance, HR, Engineering, etc.)
Templates for large-scale deployment
CI/CD-compatible automation scripts
Tested and validated on lab and production environments


**Automation Tools**

Python: Netmiko, NAPALM for on-demand config pushes
Ansible: Role-based VLAN provisioning and device config management
